# Data-driven story editor

Hey there. This is a demo for a very simple data-driven story editor.



## Formatting

I can do  ***formatting here, as you can see.***



## Storage

I can also save this .md file. (check out the url for this page)



## Data visualization

Lastly, we can create custom "components" on this editor. Check out this table:
