# Data-driven story editor

Hey there. This is a demo for a very simple data-driven story editor.

### ***<u>New content</u>***



<FlatUiTable url="https://storage.openspending.org/alberta-budget/__os_imported__alberta_total.csv" />











<LineChart data="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/oil-prices/main/data/wti-year.csv" xAxis="Date" yAxis="Price" />





## Formatting

I can do  ***formatting here, as you can see.***

## Storage

I can also save this .md file. (check out the url for this page)

## Data visualization

Lastly, we can create custom "components" on this editor. Check out this table:

<FlatUiTable url="https://storage.openspending.org/alberta-budget/__os_imported__alberta_total.csv" />

And this chart

<LineChart data="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/oil-prices/main/data/wti-year.csv" xAxis="Date" yAxis="Price" />
